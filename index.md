Commonly asked questions:
-what is NonTerra: NT is an upcoming survival game that takes place on another planet, with tamable monsters, befriendable alien buddys, and tons of different biomes, world events, and more...
-what is the map like for NT: we are thinking procedural which means when you "make a new world" it randomly generates the terrain as you explore,  (so in other words, minecraft, terraria, or NMS)
-when is NT coming out: (THIS MAY CHANGE DEPENDING ON DEVELOPMENT) we are thinking that early access will be out by december, and full release by next winter so keep that in mind
